## Description
The Microsaccade Toolbox is a collection of functions to analyze fixational eye movements based on data recorded via high-resolution (>200 Hz) eye-tracking. The topics implemented in this python implementation are the same as in the original R implementation that can be found [here](http://read.psych.uni-potsdam.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=140:engbert-et-al-2015-microsaccade-toolbox-for-r&catid=26:publications&Itemid=34): 
- detection of microsaccades
- statistical analysis using surrogate data
- random-walk analysis of fixational eye movements

Microsaccade detection is based on an algorithm that implements a velocity threshold to identify (micro)saccades in eye-tracking traces [1–3]. Statistical tests of microsaccade detection can be performed against phase-randomized surrogate data [4] to evaluate the reliability of the detection threshold and data quality. For more general statistical properties of fixational eye movements, random-walk [5, 6] and box-count [2] analyses are implemented to investigate the interaction between slow fixational eye movements (drift) with microsaccades.
